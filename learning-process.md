### 2.1 In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In "Learning How to Learn," the most interesting part for me was about the Pomodoro Technique. It's a method where you work for 25 minutes and then take a short break. This helps you get more done and makes learning easier by mixing focused work with relaxed thinking.

*  Active Thinking: This is when you pay close attention to what you're doing, like when you're solving a puzzle problem or playing chess.

*  Diffused Thinking: This is when your mind is relaxed and wandering, like when you're daydreaming, or taking a bath, or sitting in the toilet, and new ideas pop up without trying hard.
