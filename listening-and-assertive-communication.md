# Listening and Active Communication

### 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

* Look at the Speaker: Imagine your friend Rishi is talking to you and make sure you look at them/eye contact, so they know you're paying attention & listing what the speaker is saying.
* Show yourself that you Listening: while your friend Rishi talks, smiles, and says little things like "Hey bro". This shows you are really listening.
* Always Say Back What You Heard: After your friend talks, you just repeat what they said in your own words. example, if he says, "I bought a new BMW bike," then you can say, "Really a new BMW bike? That sounds cool!"
* Don’t Interrupt: Wait until your friend is done talking before you say anything. This way, you hear everything they want to say.
* Give Answer Kindly: When it is your turn to talk, think about your words. If your friend says they are upset, you can say, "Bro what's happened? Can I help?"
* Understand Their Feelings: Try to imagine how your friend feels. If they are happy, be happy with them. If they are sad, show you care. This helps your friends know you understand them.

### 5. When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

when I feel shy or don’t want to cause any problems. For example, if a friend asks me to help with a project and I really don't have time but I say "yes" because I don’t want to see upset.

### 6. When do you switch to Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

when I get angry or frustrated. For example, if a friend takes my things without asking, I might shout at them or say something bad words  because I'm upset.

### 7. When do you switch to Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?
